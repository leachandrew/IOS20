<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p><strong>Choose four</strong> questions to answer. Questions draw from course lectures, discussions, and readings.</p>
<p>You may discuss the questions, but you must write your own responses and turn in your own work. Answers that are substantially similar will be interpretted cheating and punished accordingly. I will not answer any questions about course content during while the exam is outstanding.</p>
<p>Each question is worth <strong>25 points.</strong> This assignment is due to me by email by <strong>8:00 PM Saturday, April 11 by email as a PDF</strong>. Starting at 8:01, you will lose 2 points for every hour it is late.</p>
<p><em>If appropriate</em>, you must be able to talk with some familiarity about arguments put forth in our readings, when relevant (informally, as in “According to Smith…”). You do not need formal citations, but it should be clear when you are referencing the readings vs. your own thinking. <em>This is not relevant for all questions!</em></p>

<li><p>How does “uncertainty” explain the origin of economic profits in the real world, as opposed to the long run equilibrium prediction of the perfect competition model? Make use of the readings in your answer.</p></li>

<li><p>People often ridicule the perfect competition model as unrealistic given its heroic assumptions about firms and markets. React to this argument, given what we have read and discussed this semester.</p></li>
<li><p>Is price discrimination “good” or “bad” for society? Explain your answer.</p></li>
