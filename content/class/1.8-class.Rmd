# Overview

Today we cover a topic that often does not get covered in microeconomics courses, but is important nonetheless for our purposes: markets for factors of production (e.g. land, labor, capital, supplies, etc). We discuss what determines prices in these markets, and how they vary with monopoly power and **monopsony power** (a buyer with market power). We primarily focus on **labor markets** as the main factor market.
