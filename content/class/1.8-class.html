<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Today we cover a topic that often does not get covered in microeconomics courses, but is important nonetheless for our purposes: markets for factors of production (e.g.Â land, labor, capital, supplies, etc). We discuss what determines prices in these markets, and how they vary with monopoly power and <strong>monopsony power</strong> (a buyer with market power). We primarily focus on <strong>labor markets</strong> as the main factor market.</p>
