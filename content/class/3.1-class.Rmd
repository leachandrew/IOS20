# Assignments: Homework 2, Midterm Exam

[Homework 2](assignment/02-problem-set) is posted, and is due via email, on Sunday, April 5, by 11:59PM. The answer key will be posted Monday, April 6. **Please attach your document as a PDF!**

Homework 1 grades are on Blackboard and the answer key is on the original assignment page.

Our midterm exam will be the week of April 6. It will likely be a take home series of questions that you can spend a few days to work on, and will email to me when you complete.

# Midterm Course Grades

As per the Registrar, all faculty were required to issue midterm course grades on Monday March 30. I *estimated* your grade based on the assignments we have completed so far - just HW 1. You can again estimate your final course grade (out of 100%) on the [<i class="fas fa-calculator"></i> `Grade Calculator`](https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/326_grade_calculator/) at the top of the [Assignments page](/assignments).
