<p><a href="assignment/02-problem-set">Homework 2</a> is posted, and is due via email, on Sunday, April 5, by 11:59PM. The answer key will be posted Monday, April 6. <strong>Please attach your document as a PDF!</strong></p>
<p>Homework 1 grades are on Blackboard and the answer key is on the original assignment page.</p>
<p>Our midterm exam will be the week of April 6. It will likely be a take home series of questions that you can spend a few days to work on, and will email to me when you complete.</p>
<h2 id="midterm-course-grades">Midterm Course Grades</h2>
<p>As per the Registrar, all faculty were required to issue midterm course grades on Monday March 30. I <em>estimated</em> your grade based on the assignments we have completed so far - just HW 1. You can again estimate your final course grade (out of 100%) on the <a href="https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/326_grade_calculator/"><i class="fas fa-calculator"></i> <code>Grade Calculator</code></a> at the top of the <a href="/assignments">Assignments page</a>.</p>
