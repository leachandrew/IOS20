# Required Readings:

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Thiel (2014), "Zero to One" Chs. 3-5^[Sorry about the quality of the PDF if that is what you use to read it. The required reading starts on page 17, "All Happy Comapanies Are Different", through the end of the document.]

This will be the first major reading and discussion that we will have this semester. On Thursday I will explain how we will hold discussions, as well as provide more context for you to interpret the readings.  

# Questions and Tips to Guide Your Reading

In combination with the lectures and all the readings, think about: 

- How can we precisely define monopoly? i.e. how do we "know it when we see it"?

- How are the economic models (i.e. fictional constructions) of "perfect competition" and "perfect monopoly" useful and/or useless for reality?

- Can monopolies emerge (and persist) naturally in the market, or does monopoly always require government intervention?

- Is monopoly "good," "bad," or some combination?
