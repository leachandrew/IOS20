<h2 id="required-readings">Required Readings:</h2>
<ul>
<li><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Thiel (2014), “Zero to One” Chs. 3-5</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be the first major reading and discussion that we will have this semester. On Thursday I will explain how we will hold discussions, as well as provide more context for you to interpret the readings.</p>
<h2 id="questions-and-tips-to-guide-your-reading">Questions and Tips to Guide Your Reading</h2>
<p>In combination with the lectures and all the readings, think about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How can we precisely define monopoly? i.e. how do we “know it when we see it”?</p></li>
<li><p>How are the economic models (i.e. fictional constructions) of “perfect competition” and “perfect monopoly” useful and/or useless for reality?</p></li>
<li><p>Can monopolies emerge (and persist) naturally in the market, or does monopoly always require government intervention?</p></li>
<li><p>Is monopoly “good,” “bad,” or some combination?</p></li>
</ul>
