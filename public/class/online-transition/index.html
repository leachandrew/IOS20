<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to online classes from quarantine!</p>
<p>None of us signed up for this. Some of you may be dealing hardships at home and at work, and may be juggling many problems right now. It may be awkward and difficult for you to learn at home, and for me to teach from home. We all are going to miss the human contact and sense of community from being together on campus.</p>
<p>Thank you to those of you who filled out my survey and gave me some helpful information. Us faculty have been training and sharing tips for the best ways to retool our courses for a sudden shift to an online semester.</p>
<p>For the rest of the semester, we are going to prioritize supporting each other as human beings during this crazy period of isolation, and use simple, accessible solutions that make sense for the most people, and above all, to be flexible. Right now, you have more important needs to worry about with your families, employment, and staying sane in isolation, than schoolwork. Prioritize them. I will be flexible with times and assignments, but will try to keep some structure to the course, and as such, some deadlines. I hope you use this course as an opportunity to escape the boredom and insanity of social isolation, and to help keep interest in understanding the world around us.</p>
<p>In addition to email, I will make myself accessible across multiple media to ensure you get the help and support you need:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zoom.us/j/458617463"><i class="fas fa-video"></i> Zoom Office Hours (MW 3:30-5:00 PM)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hood-io.slack.com"><i class="fab fa-slack"></i> Class Slack Channel</a><span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Join with <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/hood-io/shared_invite/zt-cyxbkvdc-ghEDdyZo30n5XF0HX06Hsw">this link</a>, which expires in 7 days.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>I will host general “office hours” during my usual time, 3:30-5PM Mondays and Wednesdays, on <strong>Zoom.</strong> You can join in with video, audio, and/or chat, whichever you feel comfortable with. Of course, if you are not available during those times, we can schedule our own time if you prefer this method over email or Slack.</p>
<p>I will also be reachable on <strong>Slack</strong><span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Join with <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/hood-io/shared_invite/zt-cyxbkvdc-ghEDdyZo30n5XF0HX06Hsw">this link</a>, which expires in 7 days.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, a common instant-messaging and collaboration app that many workplaces use, and I have used in some advanced courses before. I have added a link at the top of our website to our course Slack channel. Feel free to use this to ask me, and each other, questions and comments about the course and material, and to maintain contact and our shared community.</p>
<p>If you had never noticed, there is a <a href="https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/306_grade_calculator/"><i class="fas fa-calculator"></i> <code>Grade Calculator</code></a> at the top of the <a href="/assignments">Assignments page</a>. Use this tool to calculate your final course grade and predict what grades you would need on remaining assignments to obtain a desired course grade.</p>
<h2 id="changes-to-course-structure-assignments">Changes to Course Structure &amp; Assignments</h2>
<p>Students who have taken economics electives with me in the past usually cite our classroom discussions as among their favorite part of the course, and the part that they learn the most from. Even though we have only had one discussion so far, I found it was quite enjoyable and found a lot of what you all had to say interesting.</p>
<p>However, the abrupt transition to an online course combined with emergency circumstances means that we cannot assume everyone has equal or sufficient access to technology and time to devote to synchronous classes and discussions.</p>
<p>As such, to the best of my ability, I have tried to keep some aspect of your feedback and thoughts on readings and contents of the course. I feel much less comfortable “telling you how it is” on a lot of these issues, and still invite your comments and critiques. Our “discussions” will be <strong>asynchronous</strong> and less frequent, allowing you to read, write, and watch my lectures at your own pace during the week.</p>
<p>I will try to keep some sort of discussion, or your ability to react and comment, going. It will probably be more asynchronous (i.e. you can complete everything on your own schedule rather than at a fixed time) and spaced out. I will post lectures and require you to comment on some ideas or readings (perhaps a short paragraph).</p>
<p>Fortunately, much of our class is already accessible online, and most assignments and lectures need only minimal changes. The following will be updated on the <a href="/syllabus">Syllabus page (and PDF)</a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Homeworks</strong> will generally be due by Sunday night at 11:59 P.M, unless otherwise noted, to provide a consistent date and time for everyone. Homeworks will be graded in the same fashion as before, and grades will be posted in Blackboard’s Grade Center, as before. Please type your answers to facilitate easier grading. Scans and photos will be accepted, but are not preferred.</p></li>
<li><p>We will still have the <strong>Midterm</strong> and the <strong>Final Exam</strong>, but they will be modified so you can take them at home. I will provide more detailed information and instructions as we get closer to the midterm.</p></li>
<li><p>All <strong>“class meetings”</strong> will be <strong>asynchronous</strong>. Videos of my lectures will be hosted via Youtube (unlisted) and posted on the <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> <strong>Class</strong> pages on this website (along with the regular slides). You can watch them at your own pace, on your own time. I <em>will</em>, however, be recording my lectures <em>live</em> via <em>Zoom</em>, during our usual class meeting times:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zoom.us/j/486416690"><i class="fas fa-video"></i> Zoom Live Class Meetings (TuTh 11:30 AM-12:45 PM)</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The recordings will be posted later in the day on Youtube and on the class pages. <strong>You are not required to attend live</strong>. You <em>can</em>, and may want to, join in live on Zoom if you want to ask me questions in real time, or want to keep to a schedule, or are missing normal human contact and sense of normalcy.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Please note, as the live lectures are recorded (and posted online), if you join in, <strong>you are consenting to be recorded.</strong> Maryland law requires all parties consent for a conversation or meeting to be recorded.<br />
<br />
</span></span> :)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Office hours</strong> will be held on <em>Zoom</em>, at their usual days and times (Monday and Wednesday 3:30-5PM), as described above.</p></li>
<li><p>We lost a week of classes due to Spring Break, so I will be adjusting and removing certain content on the schedule page to prioritize more important material.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Readings, discussions, and discussion grading</strong>, when we have our few remaining discussions, will still be out of 5 points, but it will now be evaluated <em>weekly.</em> <strong>You no longer need to email me questions.</strong> When we do have a discussion, I will open up a <strong>Discussion Thread</strong> on <strong>Blackboard</strong> for the week.<span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">To access, go to our course on Blackboard, and on the blue toolbar on the left, go to Discussion Board. There is a test forum and thread that I created that you can feel free to reply to, to make sure everything works for you.<br />
<br />
</span></span> I am interested in your thoughts, reactions, comments, and questions about any of the material (lectures and/or readings). You do not need to write more than a paragraph. Anything more than that, including continuing to reply to each others’ thoughts, questions, or comments, (which I strongly hope you do!) is solely based on your own interest and curiosity. I will jump in to answer questions the group is stuck on, give my 2 cents, and stir the pot as needed. I strontly hope we still keep a conversation going and can learn from each other, that was always my goal, not to lecture at you! If you crave visual human contact, you can submit your comments/reactions in the form of a short video, and we can try that out!<span><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Though we might eventually need to move beyond Blackboard in that case. We’ll see how things go.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Your participation grade will remain the average out of 5 points for the semester.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Please let me know if you will have difficulty accessing materials or completing assignments at any point this semester. These are special circumstances for everyone. None of us signed up for an online course, and we all have to juggle additional hardships and responsibilities during this chaotic time. I am more concerned for your safety and sanity than your grades, and will be as flexible and generous as I can be.</p>
<p><strong>The syllabus, including assignments, course format, course content/schedule, and grading, remain subject to change throughout this semester as we experiment.</strong> I will give ample warning and solicit feedback before other major changes.</p>
<p>Lastly, please know that I am wide open to suggestions and feedback! Let me know what is working, and what isn’t working for you. This matters more than ever because I am now reaching each of you <em>individually</em>, rather than as a <em>single class together</em> in person!</p>
<h2 id="specific-changes-for-current-assignments">Specific Changes for Current Assignments</h2>
<p>Thank you again to those of you who filled out the online survey. It seems most of you are in good shape in terms of accessing materials, and hopefully those of you that left some on campus will have the ability to retrieve them in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2 id="position-paper">Position Paper</h2>
<p>I had originally intended this to be your reactions to a few topics that we will discuss towards the end of the course (antitrust, platforms, and some proposed solutions). I had thought about switching this to having each of you explore an industry and write about it, but there will not be much time for you to do that. I will prioritize us getting to some of the proposals and antitrust, to allow you to write a few pages in response for this assignment. If it looks like we will not get to these topics with at least a few weeks, I will waive this assignment.</p>
<h2 id="homeworks">Homeworks</h2>
<p>I will post up answer keys and your grades for HW 1, and once we finish a few more topics in class, will give you HW 2 to work on.</p>
<h2 id="resuming-classes">Resuming Classes</h2>
<p>We resume the course on Tuesday, March 24 with <em>2.4 - Contestable Markets</em>. Look on the <a href="/class/2.4-class"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> 2.4 class page</a> before class begins for a link to the live Zoom stream, and later that day for the videos of the lecture, and other resources.</p>
