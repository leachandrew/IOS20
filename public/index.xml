Overview Today we cover a topic that often does not get covered in microeconomics courses, but is important nonetheless for our purposes: markets for factors of production (e.g. land, labor, capital, supplies, etc). We discuss what determines prices in these markets, and how they vary with monopoly power and monopsony power (a buyer with market power).</description>

Quarantine Lecture 4
Overview Today we continue looking at the “theory of the firm” launched by Coase (1937). We explore a famous interpretation (among other intepretations) of the firm as a “nexus of contracts” in the marketplace. This comes from a famous paper by Alchian and Demsetz (1972), which views the firm not as a command-and-control hierarchy, but another nexus of voluntary market transactions, where collaborating factors of production find it in their interest to hire a monitor to minimize shirking, and give the monitor residual claimancy over the output.</description>

Quarantine Lecture 6
Overview Today we cover another major framework for studying the theory of the firm, the theory of asset specificity. This approach focuses on the threat of opportunism by parties that have signed a contract and made specific investments (sunk costs) by depending on one another: parties could try to extort greater quasi-rents from one another, or else threaten to pull out of the contract, harming the other party.</description>

Overview Today we look at the other major solution to post-contractual opportunism caused by asset specificity: writing restrictive long-term contracts. We look at examples such as franchising, exclusivity agreements, territorial restraints, and resale price maintenance.

Required Readings:   Thiel (2014), Zero to One Chs. 3-5Sorry about the quality of the PDF if that is what you use to read it. The required reading starts on page 17, “All Happy Comapanies Are Different”, through the end of the document.
  You are required to read chapters 3-5, though I highly recommend you read chapters 1 and 2 as well. This is a very short (and hopefuly interesting and readable) book, so reading many chapters from it is not as daunting as it sounds!</description>

 is one of the most common fields of applied microeconomics. It traditionally studies business firms and their relationship to the market–how they make economic decisions, how they are affected by government regulation, how they strategically interact with one another–and how these change in markets that are more or less competitive–monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition, or perfect competition, often with a close connection to antitrust law.</description>
