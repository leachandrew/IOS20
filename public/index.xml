Overview Today we cover a topic that often does not get covered in microeconomics courses, but is important nonetheless for our purposes: markets for factors of production (e.g. land, labor, capital, supplies, etc). We discuss what determines prices in these markets, and how they vary with monopoly power and monopsony power (a buyer with market power).</description>

Required Readings:   Thiel (2014), Zero to One Chs. 3-5Sorry about the quality of the PDF if that is what you use to read it. The required reading starts on page 17, “All Happy Comapanies Are Different”, through the end of the document.
  You are required to read chapters 3-5, though I highly recommend you read chapters 1 and 2 as well. This is a very short (and hopefuly interesting and readable) book, so reading many chapters from it is not as daunting as it sounds!</description>

 is one of the most common fields of applied microeconomics. It traditionally studies business firms and their relationship to the market–how they make economic decisions, how they are affected by government regulation, how they strategically interact with one another–and how these change in markets that are more or less competitive–monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition, or perfect competition, often with a close connection to antitrust law.</description>
