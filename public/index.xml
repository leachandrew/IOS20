Overview Today we cover a topic that often does not get covered in microeconomics courses, but is important nonetheless for our purposes: markets for factors of production (e.g. land, labor, capital, supplies, etc). We discuss what determines prices in these markets, and how they vary with monopoly power and monopsony power (a buyer with market power).</description>

Quarantine Lecture 3
Overview Today we continue looking at the “theory of the firm” launched by Coase (1937). We explore a famous interpretation (among other intepretations) of the firm as a “nexus of contracts” in the marketplace. This comes from a famous paper by Alchian and Demsetz (1972), which views the firm not as a command-and-control hierarchy, but another nexus of voluntary market transactions, where collaborating factors of production find it in their interest to hire a monitor to minimize shirking, and give the monitor residual claimancy over the output.</description>

Required Readings:   Thiel (2014), Zero to One Chs. 3-5Sorry about the quality of the PDF if that is what you use to read it. The required reading starts on page 17, “All Happy Comapanies Are Different”, through the end of the document.
  You are required to read chapters 3-5, though I highly recommend you read chapters 1 and 2 as well. This is a very short (and hopefuly interesting and readable) book, so reading many chapters from it is not as daunting as it sounds!</description>
