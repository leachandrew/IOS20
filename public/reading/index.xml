Required Readings:   Thiel (2014), “Zero to One” Chs. 3-5Sorry about the quality of the PDF if that is what you use to read it. The required reading starts on page 17, “All Happy Comapanies Are Different”, through the end of the document.
  This will be the first major reading and discussion that we will have this semester. On Thursday I will explain how we will hold discussions, as well as provide more context for you to interpret the readings.</description>
