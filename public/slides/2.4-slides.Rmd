# Wrapup of Oligopoly

Three canonical models of Oligopoly

1. .hi[Bertrand competition]
  - Firms **simultaneously** compete on **price**
2. .hi[Cournot competition]
  - Firms **simultaneously** compete on **quantity**
3. .hi[Stackelberg competition]
  - Firms **sequentially** compete on **quantity**

# Wrapup of Oligopoly

- See some visualizations I made:
  1. [Cournot: Symmetric Market Changes](https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/Cournot_market_changes/)
  2. [Cournot: Asymmetric Costs](https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/cournot_asymmetric_costs/)
  3. [Cournot: With n Firms](https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/Cournot_n_firms/)

Major implications from Cournot:

1. As $\uparrow$ number of firms: $\downarrow q$, $\downarrow p$, $\downarrow \pi$, $\uparrow CS$, $\downarrow DWL$ (closer to perfect competition)

2. If a firm has lower costs than others, earns greater profit. Firms will want to (equivalently):
  - lower their own costs
  - raise rivals' costs

- We can use backwards induction to find the outcome of the game

- Start with best response of .hi-blue[Incumbent] at .blue[I.2] and .blue[I.3]...then best response of .hi-blue[Entrant] at .red[E.1] and .red[E.2]...then .hi-blue[Incumbent] at .blue[I.1]

- Define the outcome in terms of their strategies:

$\big \{$ .blue[(Invest, Fight, Accommodate)], .red[(Stay Out, Enter)] $\big \}$

- The **equilibrium path of play** is .blue[Invest], then .red[Stay Out]

- Note via backward induction, we've shown the optimal response by each player at each decision node

$\big \{$ .blue[(Invest, Fight, Accommodate)], .red[(Stay Out, Enter)] $\big \}$

- SPNE: this set of strategies induces a Nash equilibrium in every subgame
  - Each player optimally responding to every contigency

- With **commitment**, it is .hi-purple[credible] for .blue[Incumbent] to threaten to .blue[Fight] if .red[Entrant] decides to .red[Enter]!

$\big \{$ .blue[(Invest, Fight, Accommodate)], .red[(Stay Out, Enter)] $\big \}$

- Note we could look at the set of strategies in normal form

- Using best response, there are *many* Nash Equilibria (boldened)!
  - But only the one we mentioned is subgame perfect!
