# Wrapup of Oligopoly

.pull-left[
Three canonical models of Oligopoly

1. .hi[Bertrand competition]
  - Firms **simultaneously** compete on **price**
2. .hi[Cournot competition]
  - Firms **simultaneously** compete on **quantity**
3. .hi[Stackelberg competition]
  - Firms **sequentially** compete on **quantity**

# Wrapup of Oligopoly

- See some visualizations I made:
  1. [Cournot: Symmetric Market Changes](https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/Cournot_market_changes/)
  2. [Cournot: Asymmetric Costs](https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/cournot_asymmetric_costs/)
  3. [Cournot: With n Firms](https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/Cournot_n_firms/)

Major implications from Cournot:

1. As `\(\uparrow\)` number of firms: `\(\downarrow q\)`, `\(\downarrow p\)`, `\(\downarrow \pi\)`, `\(\uparrow CS\)`, `\(\downarrow DWL\)` (closer to perfect competition)

2. If a firm has lower costs than others, earns greater profit. Firms will want to (equivalently):
  - lower their own costs
  - raise rivals' costs

# Contestable Markets I

1. .hi-red[**Incumbent**] which sets its price `\(\color{red}{p_I}\)`

2. .hi-blue[**Entrant**] decides to **stay out** or **enter** the market, setting its price `\(\color{blue}{p_E}\)`

- Price competition between the two firms with similar products&lt;sup&gt;.hi-red[1]&lt;/sup&gt; `\(\implies\)` consumers buy only from the firm with the lower price

# What About *Sunk* Costs? I

.pull-left[
- Fixed costs `\(\implies\)` do not vary with output

- If firm exits, could sell these assets (e.g. machines, real estate) to recover costs
  - Thus, "hit-and-run" competition remains potentially profitable
  - Maintains credible threat against incumbent acting as a monopolist

# What About *Sunk* Costs? II

.pull-left[
- These are bygones to the .hi-red[Incumbent], who has already committed to producing

- But are *new* costs and risk to .hi-blue[Entrant], lowering expected profits

- In effect, sunk costs raise `\(\color{blue}{c_E}&gt;\color{red}{c_I}\)`, and return us back to the second example

- Nash equilibrium:
  - .hi-red[Incumbent] can deter entry with `\(\color{red}{p_I}=\color{blue}{p_E}-\epsilon\)`
  - Inefficient, `\(p&gt;AC\)`, but again not as bad as pure monopoly

# Contestable Markets: Recap

.pull-left[
- .whisper[Markets are **contestable** if]:
  1. There are no barriers to entry or exit
  2. Firms have similar technologies (i.e. similar cost structure)
  3. There are no sunk costs
  
- Economies of scale need not be inconsistent with competitive markets (as is assumed) if they are contestable

- Generalizes "prefect competition" model in more realistic way, also game-theoretic
