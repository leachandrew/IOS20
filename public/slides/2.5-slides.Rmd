# Is Monopoly a Nash Equilibrium?

- **Monopolist** maximizes $\pi$ by setting $q^*$: $MR=MC$ and $p^*=Demand(q^*)$

- This is *an* equilibrium, but is it the *only* equilibrium?

- We've assumed just a *single* player in the model

# Contestable Markets I

.pull-left[

- Model the market as an .hi-purple[entry game], with two players:

1. .hi-red[**Incumbent**] which sets its price $\color{red}{p_I}$

2. .hi-blue[**Entrant**] decides to **stay out** or **enter** the market, setting its price $\color{blue}{p_E}$

- Bertrand price competition between the two firms with similar products $\implies$ consumers buy only from the firm with the lower price
