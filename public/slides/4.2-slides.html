# Private Antitrust Suits

.smaller[
&gt; "Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation. .hi[By offering potential litigants the prospect of a recovery in three times the amount of their damages, Congress encouraged these persons to serve as 'private attorneys general.'"]

# Before Antitrust Laws: Public Hatred of Monopoly

&gt; "[A man lives] in a house built with monopoly bricks, with windows...of monopoly glass; heated by monopoly coal (in Ireland monopoly timber), burning in a grate made of monopoly iron...He washed himself in monopoly soap, his clothes in monopoly starch. He dressed in monopoly lace, monopoly linen, monopoly leather, monopoly gold thread...His clothes were dyed with monopoly dyes. He ate monopoly butter, monopoly currants, monopoly red herrings, monopoly salmon, and monopoly lobsters. His food was seasoned with monopoly salt, monopoly pepper, monopoly vinegar...He wrote with monopoly pens, on monopoly writing paper; read (through monopoly spectacles, by the light of monopoly candles) monopoly printed books," (quoted in Acemoglu and Robinson 2011, pp.187-188).

If the law has regulated or restrained his mode of doing this, the law must be obeyed. But no power short of the general law ought to restrain his free discretion."

- Much of the evolution came from changes in the theory and antitrust models used
  - c.1920s: rise of "perfect competition" models
  - c.1970s-: public choice, law and economics, new institutional economics, game theory
  - c.2010s-: "hipster" antitrust?

- For the middle part of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, economists united in suspicion of bigness, mergers, and market concentration

&gt; "Count the number of firms in an industry. If it's 1, it's a monopoly!"

# Key Question: Competitive?

&gt; "[E]conomic theory since [the Sherman Act] has proven remarkably fertile in pointing out how various actions by firms may be interpreted as either procompetitive or anticompetitive...Although economic theory can help organize analysis of the economic variables affected by antitrust policy, it often offers little policy guidance because almost any action by a firm short of outright price fixing can turn out to have procompetitive or anticompetitive consequences," (p.3)

- American economists were widely skeptical of Sherman Act!

- Viewed it as either unnecessary or harmful
  - Would stop the irresistible trend towards economies of scale and superior efficiency

- Few saw it as a tool to control abusive business conduct

.pull-right[

- Not to say that all economists were *lassiez-faire* or wanted no government intervention

- Debate about whether competition endangered insutries with high fixed costs and low marginal costs
  - Natural monopolies like railroads, utilities
  - Some advocated government ownership or regulation to ensure firms recover fixed costs
  - Some recognized that price discrimination allows firms to recover fixed costs
  - We'll cover natural monopoly another day

- More *per se* rules prohibiting many of vertical constraints: exclusive dealing, tying, territorial restraints, resale price maintenance
