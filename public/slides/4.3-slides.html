- Mises quote on consumer sovereignty

- Some argue that without antitrust laws, market forces exist to promote competition and prevent special interests from capturing

- government action creates a venue for regulatory capture, where 

- 


“progressive” idea was one of “political rationalization of business and industrial conditions, a movement that operated on the assumption that general welfare of the community could be served best by satisfying the concrete needs of business” (Kolko 1963: 2-3)

Woodrow Wilson (1912: 188) said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York, Government cannot take its hands off of business. Government must regulate business, because that is the foundation of every other relationship, particularly of the political relationships. It is futile, therefore, to have the politicians take their hands off. They may blunder at the business, but they cannot give up. They may make fundamental mistakes – they will make a great many if you do not frankly assist and instruct them – but they must go forward whether instructed or not.  

The problem, as Kolko (1963: 3) notes, is “the regulation itself was invariably controlled by the leaders of the regulated industry, and directed towards ends they deemed acceptable and desirable.”  

“competition was unacceptable to many key business and financial interests, and the merger movement was to a large extent a reflection of voluntary, unsuccessful business efforts to bring irresistible competitive trends under control” (Kolko 1963: 4).

though [the Sherman] Act was an attempt by small and medium sized business to protect themselves from the greater efficiencies of the larger businesses within the same or competing industries (Kolko 1963; Weinstein 1968; DiLorenzo 1985, Armentano 1999). As DiLorenzo (1985: 81) notes, the Sherman Act was due to Congress’s objections “to the fact that less efficient (smaller) businessmen (‘honest men’) were driven out of business.

“it was not the existence of monopoly that caused the federal government to intervene in the economy, but the lack of it” (Kolko 1963: 5).'


Dorsey (1995: 728), Roosevelt sought to pressure businessmen into reforming themselves. “He believed that the very threat of anti-trust legislation might convince corporate leaders to do business in the proper spirit of public service. He put the captains of industry on notice that if they failed to police themselves, to engage in what he considered moral behavior, then government would be forced to intervene” (Ibid.). In his attempt to do so, Roosevelt had a direct effect on who the Attorney General sought under antitrust law, personally directing him who to file suit against and who not to (Bittlingmayer 1996: 386).

These men, although close to Roosevelt, greatly feared public clamor for regulation and his of ‘Trustbusting’ as a political issue. It was clear to them that when Roosevelt denounced ‘bad’ trusts his main target was Rockefeller and his Standard Oil Company, rather than the Morgan and other corporations in the Civic Federation.”



"it is business control over politics (and by the ‘business’ I mean the major economic interests) rather than political regulation of the economy that is the significant phenomenon of the Progressive era" (Kolko 1963: 3)

These businessmen desired what they called “rationalization,” which was the “organization of the economy and the larger political sphere in a manner that will allow corporations to function in a predictable and secure environment permitting reasonable profits over the long run” (Kolko 1963: 3). Essentially, businessmen recognized the insecurity that comes with the unhampered market.  

The moral of the whole matter is this: The business of the United States is not as a whole in contact with the government of the United States. So as soon as it is, the matter which now give you, and justly give you, cause for uneasiness disappear. Just so soon as the business of this country has general, free, welcome access to the councils of congress, all the friction between business and politics will disappear (Wilson 1912: 200).


 Most of “the new laws attacking unfair competitors and price discrimination meant that government would now make it possible for many trade associations to stabilize, for the first time, prices within their industries, and to make effective oligopoly a new phase of the economy” (Kolko 1963: 268)
 
Many of the big businessmen disliked the Sherman Antitrust Act11 due to its vague content. Roosevelt would often make a distinction between “good” and “bad” trusts, making businessmen uneasy.  -- Highlighted Jan 26, 2017

Even labor leaders took issue with the wording of the Sherman act, understanding their need to be sure that “nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor organizations” (quoted in Kolko 1963: 263). Unionists wanted to be sure that trade organizations were exempted from the antitrust legislation. 

Trans-Missouri Freight Association case of 1897 had laid down a particularly narrow view of the Sherman Act...Supreme Court had declared there was no difference between reasonable and unreasonable restraints on trade. Both were considered illegal. (Weinstein 1968)

 The sharpened definition meant that an even greater portion of the industrial world may fall into violation of the Sherman Act. In reality, the Act was being used to aid small business, shutting down any firm that grew too large (Kolko 1963; Weinstein 1968; DiLorenzo 1985; Armentano 1999). 

p.16: Hammond (1911) continued, “Ruinous Competition, involving the conduct of business without profit, is not to be encouraged, but, on the contrary, should be depreciated, as it deters the investment of Capital and other Kindred enterprises.”  -- Highlighted Jan 26, 2017

# Private Antitrust Suits

&gt; "Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation. .hi[By offering potential litigants the prospect of a recovery in three times the amount of their damages, Congress encouraged these persons to serve as 'private attorneys general.'"]

He dressed in monopoly lace, monopoly linen, monopoly leather, monopoly gold thread...His clothes were dyed with monopoly dyes. He ate monopoly butter, monopoly currants, monopoly red herrings, monopoly salmon, and monopoly lobsters. His food was seasoned with monopoly salt, monopoly pepper, monopoly vinegar...He wrote with monopoly pens, on monopoly writing paper; read (through monopoly spectacles, by the light of monopoly candles) monopoly printed books," (quoted in Acemoglu and Robinson 2011, pp.187-188).

# Antitrust Thinking and the History of Economic Thought

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- Economists' views on antitrust evolved over the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century

- Antitrust laws and their interpretation in the courts &amp; government agencies has similarly evolved

- Much of the evolution came from changes in the theory and antitrust models used
  - c.1920s: rise of "perfect competition" models
  - c.1970s-: public choice, law and economics, new institutional economics, game theory
  - c.2010s-: "hipster" antitrust?

- Note: this "story" heavily adapted from Kovacic and Shapiro, 2000

# Key Attitude: Bigness

.pull-left[
.center[
![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3h37ge5bmvety7y/marketpower.jpg?raw=1)
]
]

.pull-right[

- Is "bigness" harmful *per se*?
  - mergers &amp; acquisitions
  - highly concentrated markets

- Economic populism: public suspicion of large business

- Are there justifications for allowing big businesses? 

]

---

# Key Attitude: Bigness

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- For the middle part of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, economists united in suspicion of bigness, mergers, and market concentration

&gt; "Count the number of firms in an industry. If it's 1, it's a monopoly!"

- Large firms must be large because they acquired undue market power

]

# Key Question: Competitive?

- Is a business activity pro-competitive or anti-competitive?



---

# Key Question: Competitive?

&gt; "[E]conomic theory since [the Sherman Act] has proven remarkably fertile in pointing out how various actions by firms may be interpreted as either procompetitive or anticompetitive...Although economic theory can help organize analysis of the economic variables affected by antitrust policy, it often offers little policy guidance because almost any action by a firm short of outright price fixing can turn out to have procompetitive or anticompetitive consequences," (p.3)

.source[Crandall, Robert W and Clifford Winston, 2003, "Does Antitrust Policy Improve Consumer Welfare? Assessing the Evidence," *Journal of Economic Perspectives* 17(4): 3-26]

---

# Phase I: 1880s-1914

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- American economists were widely skeptical of Sherman Act!

- Viewed it as either unnecessary or harmful
  - Would stop the irresistible trend towards economies of scale and superior efficiency

- Few saw it as a tool to control abusive business conduct

]

---

# Phase I: 1880s-1914

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- Not to say that all economists were *lassiez-faire* or wanted no government intervention

- Debate about whether competition endangered insutries with high fixed costs and low marginal costs
  - Natural monopolies like railroads, utilities
  - Some advocated government ownership or regulation to ensure firms recover fixed costs
  - Some recognized that price discrimination allows firms to recover fixed costs
  - We'll cover natural monopoly another day

]

---

# Phase II: 1914-1936

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- Clayton Act, the new FTC, and rule of reason dominates antitrust cases

- Many saw WWI cooperation of Big Government and Big Business as a good thing to continue in peacetime

- Use industrial trade associations with government to eliminate the "wastefulness of competition"
]

---

# Phase II: 1914-1936

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- Great Depression led many to repudiate the competitive model as a workable ideal

- New Deal focus on industrial planning, cartelization of industries

- Supreme Court not as aggressively going after monopolies

- Economists favored benefits of economies of scale 
]

---

# Phase III: 1936-1972

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- New Deal wearing off, more focus on return to competition

- Renewed vigor for antitrust enforcement, deconcentrating industries, breaking up firms

- Early Chicago School of economics: Simons, Viner, Knight
  - Free market view: antitrust ensures competition &amp; is preferable to government regulation

]

---

# Phase III: 1936-1972

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- Courts &amp; economists emphasizing the .hi-purple[structure conduct performace (SCP) paradigm]
  - Measuring market concentration &amp; market structure, markups, HHI

- High-water mark for the "perfect competition" model

- Ideal was an industry with many firms, `\(p=MC\)`, no strategic behavior

- Markets that were more concentrated, and business practices that deviated from P.C. viewed at with extreme suspicion

- Innovation more important than economies of scale (and bigness)

]

---

# Phase III: 1936-1972

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
- More *per se* rules prohibiting many of vertical constraints: exclusive dealing, tying, territorial restraints, resale price maintenance
  - no rationale for them, they must be anti-competitive!

- By 1960s, pendulum swung too far, Justice Potter Stewart: "the government always wins" [in merger decisions]

]

---

# Phase IV: 1972-1991

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- Next generation of Chicago School of economics: Friedman, Stigler, Bork, Posner, Coase
  - critical of earlier antitrust enforcement
  - critical of entry &amp; price regulations

- Found "pro-competitive" efficiency explanations for lots of seemingly "anti-competitive" firm behaviors:
  - industrial concentration (market share `\(\neq\)` market power)
  - mergers (asset specificity, double marginalization)
  - verticals restraints (asset specificity, restrain postcontractual opportunism)

- Revision of many *per se* rules to *rule of reason*, courts more permissive of mergers
]

---

# Phase IV: 1972-1991

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- Goal of antitrust is to maximize .hi[consumer welfare]

- Business activities that may *look* anti-competitive can actually increase consumer welfare, and should be allowed
  - Antitrust should protect *competition*, not *competitors*!
]

---


# Phase IV: 1972-1991

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- Rise of game theory in IO

- Predatory pricing and entry deterrence *can* be anti-competitive

- Game theory can be used to show that some behaviors *could* be anti-competitive or *could* be competitive
  - i.e. consider entry game with commitment vs. contestable market game
]

---

# Phase V: 1991-Present

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- Chicago School less dominant, but synthesis with rest of economics profession

- Rise of New Empirical Industrial Organization
  - focus on empirical studies, merger simulations, identifying market power with econometric tools
  
- Merger analysis became more heavily economic
  - DOJ's Horizontal Merger Guidelines replete with economic concepts
  - Close connection between lawyers &amp; economists in antitrust agencies

- Increasing focus on innovation, intellectual property
]

Suspicions of monopoly come baked-in with our models:

- "That vertical integration has never enjoyed a secure place in value theory is attributable to the fact that, under conventional assumptions, it is an anomaly: if the costs of operating competitive markets are zero, "as is usu- ally assumed in our theoretical analysis" (Arrow, 1969, p. 48), why integrate?" - Williamson (1971) the Vertical Integration of Production: Market Failure Considerations* p.112

Antitrust Areas: Monopolization

---

# Monopolization

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- Very rare for DOJ to bring monopolization suits, drag on for many years

- Government must prove firm has:
  - (a) power over price and output and 
  - (b) this comes from business decisions with the explicit goal to exclude competition

- Remedies:
  - Horizontal divestiture: break up into separate horizontal competitors
  - Vertical divestiture: break up into separate companies along supply chain
  - Consent decrees: end anticompetitive practices like tying, predatory pricing, etc
  - Sell off or license intellectual property (if this is the source of monopoly)

]

# Recent Examples: United States v. AT&amp;T

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

- AT&amp;T was protected as a natural monopoly through its Bell System network of companies for decades (another story for another lecture)
  - sole provider of telephone service in nearly all of United States

- In 1970s FCC suspected AT&amp;T was using monopoly profits from its Western Electric subsidiary to subsidize the costs of its network

- DOJ brought a monopolization case against AT&amp;T in 1972

- DOJ disagreed, thought Microsoft violated `\(\S 1\)` and `\(\S 2\)` of Sherman Act
  - sought to break up microsoft into two companies, one for OS, one for other software

- Settlement in 2001: Microsoft must share its API for Windows, DOJ dropped its threats to break up
