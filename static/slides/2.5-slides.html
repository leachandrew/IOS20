- If firm exits, could sell these assets (e.g. machines, real estate) to recover costs

.pull-left[
- These are bygones to the .hi-red[Incumbent], who has already committed to producing

- But are *new* costs and risk to .hi-blue[Entrant], lowering expected profits

- In effect, sunk costs raise `\(\color{blue}{c_E}&gt;\color{red}{c_I}\)`, and return us back to our second example

- .hi[Nash equilibrium]: .hi-red[Incumbent] deters entry with `\(\color{red}{p_I}=\color{blue}{p_E}-\epsilon\)`
  - Inefficient, `\(p&gt;AC\)`, but again not monopoly

# Contestable Markets: Recap

.pull-left[
- .hi-purple[Markets are **contestable** if]:
  1. There are no barriers to entry or exit
  2. Firms have similar technologies (i.e. similar cost structure)
  3. There are no sunk costs
  
- Economies of scale need not be inconsistent with competitive markets (as is assumed) if they are contestable

- Generalizes "prefect competition" model in more realistic way, also game-theoretic

The only answer I can think of is: **we just cared more**. 
**While some doubted** that connecting the world was actually important, **we were building**. While others doubted that this would be sustainable, **we were forming lasting connections**."

&gt; "In an economic system the realization of profits is the criterion according to which successful and surviving firms are selected...Realized positive profits, not *maximum* profits, are the mark of success and viability. It does not matter through what process of reasoning or motivation such success was achieved. The fact of its accomplishment is sufficient. This is the criterion by which the economic system selects survivors: those who realize *positive profits* are the survivors; those who suffer losses disappear," (p.213).

&gt; "Positive profits accrue to those who are better than their actual competitors, even if the participants are ignorant, intelligent, skillful, etc. The crucial element is one's aggregate position relative to actual competitors, not hypotheticallhy perfect competitors. As in a race, the award goes to the relatively fastest, even if all the competitors loaf. Even in a world of stupid men there would still be profits. Also, the greater the uncertainties of the world, the greater is the possibility that profits would go to venturesome and lucky rather than to logical, careful, fact-gathering, individuals," (p.213).

&gt; "It appears to be generally held that the so-called theory of 'perfect competition' provides the appropriate model for judging the effectiveness of competition in real life and that, to the extent that real competition differs from that model, it is undesirable and even harmful. For this attitude there seems to me to exist very little justification....[W]hat the theory of perfect competition discusses has little claim to be called 'competition' at all, and that its conclusions are of little use as guides to policy."

&gt; "[The Perfect competition model] throughout assumes that state of affairs *already to exist* which...the *process of competition* tends to *bring about* (or to approximate) and that, if the state of affairs assumed by the theory of perfect competition ever existed, it would not only deprive of their scope all the activities which the verb "to compete" describes but would make them virtually impossible. ... Advertising, undercutting, and improving ('differentiating') the goods or services produced are all excluded by definition — 'perfect' competition means indeed the absence of all competitive activities."

&gt; When we deal, however, with a situation in which a number of persons are attempting to work out their separate plans...the problem becomes one of how the "data" of the different individuals on which they base their plans are adjusted to the objective facts of their environment (which includes the actions of the other people).

&gt; Or, to anticipate our main conclusion in a brief statement, competition is by its nature a dynamic process whose essential characteristics are assumed away by the assumptions underlying static analysis [in the perfect competition model].

&gt; Yet the current tendency in discussion is to be intolerant about the imperfections and to be silent about the prevention of competition. We can probably still learn more about the real significance of competition by studying the results which regularly occur where competition is deliberately suppressed than by concentrating on the shortcomings of actual competition compared with an ideal which is irrelevant for the given facts.

&gt; "I say advisedly "where competition is deliberately suppressed" and not merely "where it is absent," because its main effects are usually operating, even if more slowly, so long as it is not outright suppressed with the assistance or the tolerance of the state."

&gt; "The evils which experience has shown to be the regular consequence of a suppression of competition are on a different plane from those which the imperfections of competition may cause. Much more serious than the fact that prices may not correspond to marginal cost is the fact that, with an entrenched monopoly, costs are likely to be much higher than is necessary."

&gt; "A monopoly based on superior efficiency, on the other hand, does comparatively little harm so long as it is assured that it will disappear as soon as anyone else becomes more efficient in providing satisfaction to the consumers."

# So What's the Point of the Models?

- In perfect competition (model):
  - price-taking firms set price equal to marginal cost
  - long run economic profits are zero
  - allocative efficiency: consumer and producer surplus maximized

- This is a *tendency* .hi[only because of **free entry and exit**]
