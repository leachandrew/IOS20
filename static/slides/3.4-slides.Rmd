> "Coase's fundamental insight [was] that transaction, coordination, and contracting costs must be considered explicitly in explaining the extent of vertical integration...[We] explore one particular cost of using the market system-the possibility of postcontractual opportunistic behavior," (p.297)

> "The particular circumstance we emphasize as likely to produce a serious threat of this type of reneging on contracts is the presence of appropriable specialized quasi rents. After a specific investment is made and such quasi rents are created, the possibility of opportunistic behavior is very real. Following Coase's framework, this problem can be solved in two possible ways: vertical integration or contracts," (p.298)

- Recap: contracting removes parties from a competitive market and creates bilateral dependency between them
  - incentives for post-contractual opportunism
  - parties may try to capture more quasi-rents from cooperation
  - may be caused by asset specificity

- Two general solutions:
  1. .hi[Contracting solutions]: write a better contract
  2. .hi[Vertical integration]: have one party buy the other

- Anglo-American common law recognizes a contract to be **valid** if there is:
  1. Offer and acceptance (a "meeting of the minds")
  2. Consideration (something of value is to be transferred)
  3. An "intention to be legally bound"

> "Klein et al. (1978) and Williamson (1979) added further content by arguing that a contractual relationship between a separately owned buyer and seller will be plagued by opportunistic and inefficient behavior in situations in which there are large amounts of surplus to be divided ex post and in which, because of the impossibility of writing a complete, contingent contract, the ex ante contract does not specify a clear division of this surplus. Such situations in turn are likely to arise when either the buyer or seller must make investments that have a smaller value in a use outside their own relationship than within the relationship (i.e., there exist 'asset specificities')," (p.692).

# Ownership As a Response to Uncertainty

"[I]f I am quite sure what kinds of actions my neighbour contemplates, I might be indifferent between his owning the field at the bottom of my garden and my owning it but renting it out for him to graze his horse in. But once I take into account that he may discover some new use for the field that I haven't yet thought of, but would find objectionable, it will be in my interest to own the field so as to put the use of it under my own control. More generally, ownership of a resource reduces exposure to unexpected events. .hi[Property rights are a means of reducing uncertainty without needing to know precisely what the source or nature of the future concern will be]," (Littlechild 1986, p. 35.)
