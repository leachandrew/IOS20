- $\S2$ of Sherman Act

- Very rare for DOJ to bring monopolization suits, drag on for many years

- Government must prove firm has:
  - (a) power over price and output and 
  - (b) this comes from business decisions with the explicit goal to exclude competition

- Remedies:
  - Horizontal divestiture: break up into separate horizontal competitors
  - Vertical divestiture: break up into separate companies along supply chain
  - Consent decrees: end anticompetitive practices like tying, predatory pricing, etc
  - Sell off or license intellectual property (if this is the source of monopoly)

]

# Monopolization

.smaller[
> "The mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system. The opportunity to charge monopoly prices at least for a short period is what attracts business acumen in the first place; it induces risk taking that produces innovation and economic growth. To safeguard the incentive to innovate, the possession of monopoly power will not be found unlawful unless it is accompanied by an element of anticompetitive conduct.


Verizon Communications Inc., v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP 540 U.S. 398 (2004)

]

# Monopolization

.smaller[
> "Firms may acquire monopoly power by establishing an infrastructure that renders them uniquely suited to serve their customers. Compelling such firms to share the source of their advantage is in some tension with the underlying purpose of antitrust law, since it may lessen the incentive for the monopolist, the rival, or both to invest in those economically beneficial facilities. Enforced sharing also requires antitrust courts to act as central planners, identifying the proper price, quantity, and other terms of dealing a role for which they are ill-suited. Moreover, compelling negotiation between competitors may facilitate the supreme evil of antitrust: collusion."

Verizon Communications Inc., v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP 540 U.S. 398 (2004)
]

# Monopolization

.smaller[
> "Persons may unwittingly find themselves in possession of a monopoly, automatically so to say: that is, without having intending either to put an end to existing competition or to prevent competition from arising when none had existed: they may become monopolist by force of accident. Since the Act makes “monopolizing” a crime, as well as a civil wrong, it would be not only unfair, but presumably contrary to the intent of Congress, to include such instances. . . . A single producer may be the survivor out of group of active competitors, merely by virtue of his superior skill, foresight, and industry. . . . The successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned upon when he wins," 

United States v. Aluminum Company of America, 148 f.2d 416 (2d CIR. 1945)

]

---

# Monopolization

> "If that allegation states an antitrust claim at all, it does so under §2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. §2, which declares that a firm shall not monopolize or attempt to monopolize. ... It is settled law that this offense requires, in addition to the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market, the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident." 

United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U. S. 563, 570571 (1966)

- But many seemingly anti-competitive practices are pro-competitive and benefit consumers:

> "For much too long a time students of the history of antitrust policy have been at least midly perplexed by the coolness with which American economists greeted the Sherman Act. Was not the nineteenth century the period in which the benevolent effects of competition were most widely extolled? Should not a profession praise a Congress which seeks to legislate its textbook assumptions into practice? And with even modest foresight, should not the economists have foreseen that the Sherman Act would put more into economists' purses than perhaps any other law ever passed?," (1).

# "New Learning" in Industrial Organization

.smallest[
> "A clue to a more satisfactory explanation may be found in the 'new learning' of industrial organization. Much of this learning doubts that antitrust law promotes competition. Brozen (1982, 14) for example, concludes that antitrust laws ' are themselves restraining output and the growth of productivty.' Harold Demsetz has said that if certain policies were continued, he would favor outright repeal of the Sherman Act...MsGee (1971,16) for example says, ' for a variety of reasons, it is simply *not* correct to assume that atomistic competition is the ultimate *policy* goal; or to regard departures from that kind of competition as necessarily bad."...Johnson (1983,3) writes '...the competitive model of economic theory not only offers littled guidance [for antitrust law], but actually points us in the wrong direction. The confusion arises because many economists fail to realize that the 'competitive model' is silent on the subject of competition,' (DiLorezno and High, 1988: 424)

# Economists Were Skeptical of the Sherman Act

> "There is no doubt that economists at the turn of the [20th] century looked upon competition as a process of enterprise and rivalry [rather than the 'perfect competition model'], and that they disapproved of antitrust law...If our thesis is correct, economists owe special attention to the meaning they attach to competition...[i]f these conclusions [based on perfect competition] are substantially different from conclusions based on rivalry, then the competitive model has very likely misdirected the profession, at least as far as antitrust policy is concernced" (p.432-433).

# The Standard Oil Case

> "The *Standard Oil* case of 1911 is a landmark in the development of antitrust law. But it is more than a famous law case: it created a legend. The firm whose history it relates to became the archetype of predatory monopoly," (p.137)

> "According to most accounts, the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey established an oil refining monopoly in the United States, in large part through the systematic use of predatory price discrimination. Standard struck down its competitors, in one market at a time, until it enjoyed a monopoly position everywhere. Similarly, it preserved its monopoly by cutting prices selectively wherever competitors dared enter...The main trouble with this 'history' is that it is logically deficient, and I can find little or no evidence to support it," (p.138).

The graph...shows the industries for which data on output from 1880 to 1900 are available...of the 17 industries, there were *increases* in output...in all but two industries, matches and castor oil...In addition, output in these industries generally expanded more rapidly than output in other industries during the 10 years leading up to the first trust-busting legislation," (p.35).

# Changes in Price Under the Pre-Sherman Act "Trusts"

> "And predictably, prices in these industries were generally *falling*, not rising, even when compared to the declining general price level. For example, the average price of steel rails fell from $58 to $32 between 1880 and 1890, or by 53 percent. The price of refined sugar fell from 9 cents per pound in 1880 to 7 cents in 1890 and to 4.5 cents in 1900; the price oflead dropped from $5.04 per pound in 1880 to $4.41 in 1890; and zinc fell from $5.51 per pound to $4.40...Perhaps the most widely attacked trusts were those in the sugar and petroleum industries. But there is evidence that the effect of these combinations or mergers was to *reduce* the prices of sugar and petroleum," (pp.35-36)

# Antitrust As Rent-Seeking

> "The political impetus for some kind of antitrust law came from the farm lobbies of mostly midwestern, agricultural states, such as Missouri. Rural cattlemen and butchers were especially eager to have statutes enacted that would thwart competition from the newly centralized meat processing facilities in Chicago. The evidence on price and output in these industries, moreover, does not support the conjecture that these industries suffered from a monopoly in the late nineteenth century, if monopoly is understood in the conventional neoclassical way as an organization of industry which tends to restrict output and raise prices. These industries were fiercely competitive because of relatively free entry and rapid technological advances such as refrigeration," (p.93)
